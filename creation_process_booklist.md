# Introduction

This file lists books that describe the creation process of something interesting (company, games). It was created as I was about to comment on a [comment on Hacker New
](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16724750) asking for books similar to [John Walker's "The Autodesk File"](https://www.fourmilab.ch/autofile/).

The file is on GitHub so the list could be augmented and saved (pr/fork).
