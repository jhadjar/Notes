&nbsp;

* __Split the session to chunks:__ 
 * One hour intense work, 5 min break.
 * Spaced out
* Create a study area, a place for work and work only.

* More active learning is more effective learning.

* __Know what you’re learning: *fact* or *concept*:__
 * Fact: A bone’s name.
 * Concept: What does it do, how does it fit.
 * Concepts stick better than facts.
 * Get the concepts first, then facts.
 * In your own words or you don’t know it.

 * To learn facts, use mnemonics:
  1. Acronyms. (Roy G. Biv) [Red orange yellow green blue indigo violet]
  2. Coined Sayings:
    * **M**y **V**ery **G**ood **M**other **J**ust **S**erved **U**s **N**ine **P**izzas:
      * **M**ercury **V**enus **E**arth **M**ars **J**upiter **S**aturn **U**ranus '**P**luto']
    * **O**h **O**h **O**h **T**o **T**aste **A**nd **F**uck **A** **G**irl's **V**irgin **A**ss, **H**oorah:
      * **O**lfactory **O**ptic **O**culomotor **T**rochlear **T**rigeminal **A**bducens **F**acial **A**coustic **G**lossopharyngeal **V**agus **S**pinal **A**ccessory **H**ypoglossal
  3. Interacting Images. (NB: Best according to him)
    Afferent vs. Efferent (nerves) sound the same?
      * Maximum interference (and confusion) for similar but not the same.
      * Find ways to *differentiate* them:
       * "SAME": Sensory Afferent Muscles Efferent.
       * "RADEO": Right Atrium DEOxygenated. (i.e: left atrium oxygenated blood)

* __Make it meaningful:__
 * Meaningful: you can relate it to what you know
 * Meaningless: you can't relate it to what you know.
 * If it’s brand new, find a way to relate it.

* __Teaching is a great way to learn:__
 * Teaching makes your gaps gaping and staring at you.
 * If you can’t explain it, you don't really understand it.
 * Teach a chair or yourself if you have to (it works).
 * Active Recitation: 80%. Reading: 20% (AR > R).

* __Study groups are underutilized:__
 * Everyone should pull their weight.
 * Members should come prepared (required reading)
 * Members should have specific questions they want answered.
  * No "I don't understand anything and haven't done any reading, teach me"
 

* __Recall vs. Recognition:__
 * Don’t confuse them
 * If you need a visual cue, it’s recognition.
 * Recall is without any help. Like in a test.

* __Sleep better to learn better__
 * Everyone has 168 hour weeks. Prioritize.

* __Taking notes is important:__
 * Jot down and expand right after lecture.
 * Fill gaps asking classmate or teacher.
 * Do it while it’s still fresh in your mind.

* __Using Textbooks:__
 * [SQ3R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQ3R):
    * Survey/Skim: look through the table of contents, chapter titles, headings, etc.
    * Question: what questions would you want to be able to answer after reading?
    * Read: read to answer these questions.
    * Recite: 20% reading, 80% reciting. Mini tests (for long term potentiation). Hide the material and try answering the questions.
    * Review: Maintenance.
