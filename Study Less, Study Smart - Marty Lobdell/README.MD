* __Split the session into chunks:__ 
 * One hour intense work, 5 min break.
* __Create a study area, a place for work and work only__:
 * It doesn't matter if it's a corner in a room.
 * Anecdote: a student used a lamp exclusively for studying and for nothing else.
 * The rationale: it anchors you to the task at hand because it serves no other purpose:
   * A bed is appropriate for sleep/sex/lying around/resting. You'll slide into one of these studying in your bed.

* __More active learning is more effective learning__:
 * Committed. Involved. Intense. No daydreaming. Give a damn.

* __Know what you’re learning: *fact* or *concept*:__
 * *Fact*: A bone’s name.
 * *Concep*t: What does the bone do, how does it fit in the human body.
 * Concepts stick better than facts.
 * Get the concepts first, then facts.
 * In your own words or you don’t know it.

 * To learn facts, use mnemonics:
    1. Acronyms. (Roy G. Biv) [Red orange yellow green blue indigo violet]
    2. Coined Sayings:
      * **M**y **V**ery **G**ood **M**other **J**ust **S**erved **U**s **N**ine **P**izzas:
        * **M**ercury **V**enus **E**arth **M**ars **J**upiter **S**aturn **U**ranus '**P**luto']
      * **O**h **O**h **O**h **T**o **T**aste **A**nd **F**uck **A** **G**reat **V**irgin'**s** **A**ss, **H**oorah:
        * **O**lfactory **O**ptic **O**culomotor **T**rochlear **T**rigeminal **A**bducens **F**acial **A**coustic **G**lossopharyngeal **V**agus **S**pinal **A**ccessory **H**ypoglossal
    3. Interacting Images. (NB: Best according to him)
      Afferent vs. Efferent (nerves) sound the same?
        * Maximum interference (and confusion) for similar but not the same.
        * Find ways to *differentiate* them:
         * "SAME": Sensory Afferent Muscles Efferent.
         * "RADEO": Right Atrium DEOxygenated. (i.e: left atrium oxygenated blood)

* __Make it meaningful:__
 * Meaningful: you can relate it to what you know
 * Meaningless: you can't relate it to what you know.
 * If it’s brand new, find a way to relate it.

* __Teaching is a great way to learn:__
 * Teaching makes your gaps gaping and staring at you.
 * If you can’t explain it, you don't really understand it.
 * Teach a chair or yourself if you have to (it works).
 * Active Recitation: 80%. Reading: 20% (AR > R).

* __Study groups are underutilized:__
 * Everyone should pull their weight.
 * Members should come prepared (required reading)
 * Members should have specific questions they want answered.
  * No "I don't understand anything and haven't done any reading, teach me"
 

* __Recall vs. Recognition:__
 * Don’t confuse Recall and Recognition.
 * If you need a visual cue, it’s *Recognition*. If you can remember it without help, it's *Recall*.
 * Recall is without any help. Like in a test.
 * Most students study with the material in front of them, then think they know the material and fail on tests because they couldn't remember. When you study with the material in front of you, it's *Recognition*. You only know what "it's about", you don't really know it. Close the books and test yourself to see if you really know it. (You don't need to look at your ID to remember your name).

* __Sleep better to learn better__
 * Everyone has 168 hour weeks. Prioritize.

* __Taking notes is important:__
 * Jot down and expand right after lecture.
 * Fill gaps asking classmate or teacher.
 * Do it while it’s still fresh in your mind.

* __Using Textbooks:__
 * [SQ3R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQ3R):
    * Survey/Skim: look through the table of contents, chapter titles, headings, etc.
    * Question: what questions would you want to be able to answer after reading?
    * Read: read to answer these questions.
    * Recite: 20% reading, 80% reciting. Mini tests (for long term potentiation). Hide the material and try answering the questions.
    * Review: Maintenance.
