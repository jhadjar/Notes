## Introduction

### What is a problem?

*	Whenever there is a gap you don't know how to cross between where you are and where you want to be, you have a problem.

### What does it mean to solve a problem?

*	Finding the appropriate way to cross the gap. A process with two major parts:

		*	Representing the gap.
		*	Searching for a means to cross it.

### The 6 aspects of human problem solving?

*	Representation.
*	Invention.
*	Search among multiple alternatives.
*	Knowledge.
*	Memory.
*	Decision making

		*	Menmonic: RISK, MD.

## 1. The Process of Representation

### What's the general problem solving sequence?

*	Recognize the problem.
*	Represent the problem (get gap's nature).
*	Plan the solution (method to cross gap).
*	Execute the plan.
*	Evaluate the solution (how good is the result?).
*	Consolidate gains (learning from experience)

	*	For easy problems: ordered sequence.
	*	For hard problems: back and forth.
