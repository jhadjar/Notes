## Introduction

### What is a problem?

*	Whenever there is a gap you don't know how to cross between where you are and where you want to be, you have a problem.

### What does it mean to solve a problem?

*	Finding the appropriate way to cross the gap. A process with two major parts:

		*	Representing the gap.
		*	Searching for a means to cross it.

### The 6 aspects of human problem solving?

*	Representation.
*	Invention (some problems require you to invent)
*	Search among multiple alternatives (a choice)
*	Knowledge (what's the ratio between a photon's energy and its momentum?)
*	Memory.
*	Decision making (factoring in parameters)

		*	Mnemonic: RISK, MD.

## 1. The Process of Representation

### What's the general problem solving sequence?

*	Recognize the problem.
*	Represent the problem (get gap's nature).
*	Plan the solution (method to cross gap).
*	Execute the plan.
*	Evaluate the solution (how good is the result?).
*	Consolidate gains (learning from experience)

	*	For easy problems: ordered sequence.
	*	For hard problems: back and forth. Ill defined. New info on problem.

			*	Mnemonic: R2PEEC
	* We're as good at problem solving as we are carrying out each of these six actions.


### How do people unerstand problems?

*	Tu understand a problem, a problem solver maps objects and relations created in his mind to objects and relations in the externally represented problem.

*	Different people might have different internal representations of the same problem.

*	Frequently, people make external representations of the whole or parts of a problem. Thse are helpful.


#### The relations of Internal and External Representations

*	Sometimes you can get away with solving only with internal representation (i.e: simple multiplication)

*	Often, the problem is more difficult and requires an external reresentation. (YMMV)

*	External representations only help if you have an internal representation (you can doodle all you want, if it's empty in there, it doesn't matter).


#### What do we need to represent in an internal representation?

Four parts to include:

	*	Goal: where we want to be when it's all said and done.

	*	Initial State: where are we.

	*	Operators: the actions that can change state (i.e: that have side effects)

	*	Restrictions on Operators: rules, etc.
