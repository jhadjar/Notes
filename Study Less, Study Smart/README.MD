* Split the session to chunks. One hour, 5 min break.

* Create a study area, a place for work and work only.

* More active learning is more effective learning.

* __Know what you’re learning: *fact* or *concept*:__
 * Fact: A bone’s name.
 * Concept: What does it do, how does it fit.
 * Concepts stick better than facts.
 * Get the concepts first, then facts.
 * In your own words or you don’t know it.
 

* __Make it meaningful:__
 * Meaningful: you can relate it to what you know
 * Meaningless: you can't relate it to what you know.
 * If it’s brand new, find a way to relate it.

* __Teaching is a great way to learn:__
 * Teaching makes your gaps gaping and staring at you.
 * If you can’t explain it, you don't really understand it.
 * Teach a chair or yourself if you have to (it works).
 * Active Recitation: 80%. Reading: 20% (AR > R).

* __Study groups are underutilized:__
 * Everyone should pull their weight.
 * Members should come prepared (required reading)
 * Members should have specific questions they want answered.
  * No "I don't understand anything and haven't done any reading, teach me"
 

* __Recall vs. Recognition:__
 * Don’t confuse them
 * If you don't know something but get an "aha" when you're shown, it's recognition.
 * If you need a visual cue, it’s recognition.
 * Recall is without any help. Like in a test.

* Sleep better to learn better.
 * Everyone has 162 hour weeks. Prioritize.

* __Taking notes is important:__
 * Jot down and expand right after lecture.
 * Fill gaps asking classmate or teacher.
 * Do it while it’s still fresh in your mind.

* Using Textbooks:
 * SQ3R:
  * Survey.
  * Question
  * Read
  * Recite.
  * Review.
